### A. TikTok Video Link Requirements
- **Public Account**: Ensure your TikTok account is not locked or private. Videos must be set to public.
- **Example Links**: Here are some examples of correct video links:
    - https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSNVTS1eE/
    - https://www.tiktok.com/@rozhak_official/video/7311522299532840198
- **Correct Link**: Copy the video link directly from the TikTok app or website to avoid errors.

### B. Error Sending Views
- **Airplane Mode**: If the error persists, switch to airplane mode and check if the Zefoy website is functional.
- **Server Issues**: The Zefoy server might be down or undergoing maintenance.
- **Incorrect Link**: Double-check that you've entered the correct TikTok video link.
- **Manual Access**: Try using the Zefoy website manually if you encounter errors.

### C. Login Failed
- **High Security**: Zefoy's security might be too robust for the tool to bypass.
- **Captcha Bypass**: The tool may be attempting to bypass the captcha on Zefoy.
- **Cloudflare Protection**: There might be issues bypassing Cloudflare or Zefoy could be under maintenance.

### D. Number of Views Received
- **More Views**: It's possible to get more than 1000 views.
- **Busy Server**: If the server is busy, you might receive fewer than 1000 views.
- **Timeframe**: Typically, you can get 1000 views within 4-10 minutes.

### E. Sudden Drop in TikTok Views
- **Suspicious Activity**: TikTok may detect unusual activity and remove views from your video.
- **Zefoy Bugs**: Since Zefoy is unofficial, there might be bugs causing this issue.
- **High Security**: TikTok's security systems might be identifying and removing bot-generated views.

Views are typically delivered to your video within 1 minute after they are sent. However, if there are issues with the Zefoy website, there might be delays or the views might not appear at all.

## Warning
Using Zefoy to increase TikTok views comes with risks, including the potential violation of TikTok’s terms of service. Excessive use may result in penalties such as account suspension or banning. Always use this tool responsibly and ensure your actions comply with TikTok’s rules and legal guidelines to avoid any negative consequences.
